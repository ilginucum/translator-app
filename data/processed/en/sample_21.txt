reissued with a murder inc remix of one of its original singles im real the rb murder remix of im real was written by ja rule who also features on the track according to rule he initially was just fucking around with the track after lopezs team gave it to him to remix but it turned out to be a hell of a record this version was successful topping the billboard hot chart for several weeks it also helped jlo to return to the top ten of the us billboard album chart the song allowed lopez to crossover from pop to rb rule said this put her in another zone and her fans arent gonna want the pop version of j lo no more they gonna want the im real version the rapper enjoyed working with lopez and called it a real collaboration because he actually worked with her in the studio the success of im real murder remix lead him to begin working on a new version of aint it funny the following august which would later be announced as the lead single to jlos remix album j to tha lo the remixes in

another remix to keep the momentum going thenupcoming artist ashanti dropped by irv gottis studio in new york she recalled everyone was there and ja rule was on the floor playing video games and they had the beat playing in the background chris gotti irv gottis brother said jas supposed to be writing this record for jlo but it doesnt look like hes going to be doing anything tonight why dont you go

song with a duration of three minutes and fortynine seconds it is thematically dissimilar to the original track while he was working towards the remix ja rule boasted im about to f yall up stating that the songs sampling of craig macks flava in ya ear would be remixed and vamped up crazy he said its totally not j lo over the reworking of the flava in ya ear beat lopez sings about a boyfriend who keeps messing up while rule and cadillac tah drop rhymes on the track rule raps that hes off the wall like mj in his early days which is a reference to michael jacksons album off the wall the rapper also says oh i never been a sucker for chocha chocha meaning pussy the slang term for vagina he continues on to say that people want him after they see him workin with money meaning working
