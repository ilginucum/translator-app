road or street name also including alleys squares parks quays and motorways theoryedit causesedit there are several different causes that can make a street name controversial a person organisation or event who or which was once honoured with a street name is subsequently thought to not or no longer deserve one for example because that person later turned out to be a criminal a group of street names for example in a residential area is deemed to be unrepresentative for the population of that place region or country because some demographics are overrepresented and others underrepresented for example because a disproportionate number of streets are named after men and few after women a street name sign is argued to not have been written in the appropriate languages or scriptsalphabets for example because the local population barely uses this language or script a street name is argued to be too complicated to memorise pronounce or spell which could cause problems in spoken communication or be too similar to another street name in the same place which could confuse ambulances firefighters or mail carriers a planned change of an existing street name is opposed by local residents and companies which would need to invest time and money in informing all their relevant contacts of their new addresses in the first two cases a street name controversy is about the symbolic contents of the name whereas in the latter three scenarios the issue is about the linguistic form of the name in the last case simply because the new name is different from the old one solutionsedit there is a broad spectrum of views on how to resolve street name controversies varying from radical change to complete maintenance of the status quo these views could be roughly categorised into the following attitudes which can overlap in practice complete maintenance of the status quo there is nothing wrong with the current street names and in the future the same or similar names can be used for other public streets and roads even if there is something wrong with it there are more important issues that deserve priority better luck next time nothing should be changed with respect to current street names itthey hashave already become too much a part of this area and an important reference to history even if there are negative connotations attached to thisthese names however when constructing new streets and roads more thought should be given to how to name them more attention should be given to underrepresented demographics and it should be carefully considered whether a person organisation or event will deserve a place of honour in the long term recontextualisation this approach is especially favoured for dealing with monument and memorial controversies but can also be applied to street names a critical balanced note is added to a street name sign or near it for example in a museum or a tourist walking route to highlight both positive and negative aspects of the person organisation or event after which the street is named so that passersby can form their own opinions about history or a special walking route with critical remarks is developed democratic consensus formal meetings are held by a city council or another relevant body to discuss and vote on name changes ad hoc consultations are held with local interest groups or a poll or referendum is held to determine what local residents think of the issue in hopes of making a decision that is supported by a majority if no majority is to be found the name will be maintained for the time being radical change the street names need to change as soon as possible and sometimes vandalism and other forms of civil disobedience may be justified to make a point influence public opinion and put pressure on local politics a name change doesnt necessarily require a majority as long as a significant group of citizens is opposed to the street name it is sufficient to mandate a change because their interests should be taken into account practical examplesedit austriaedit world war ii in postwar austria franz langoth was long viewed as a good nazi who bore no responsibility for the excesses of the regime therefore in a street in his hometown linz where he served as mayor in was renamed langothstrae despite these beliefs langoth always maintained his nationalsocialist beliefs and publicly defended them for this reason the street name was eventually restored to its original name of kaisergasse in belgiumedit french names defaced in the village of recht in the germanspeaking community of belgium wikimedia commons has media related to vandalised bilingual road signs in belgium because of language issues see also list of statues of leopold ii of belgium language struggle further information language legislation in belgium francization of brussels and voeren linguistic and political issues in the brussels capital region eupenmalmedy and the municipalities with language facilities both street names and road signs are officially bilingual language activists from several sides are however arguing that these should be monolingual in certain areas in favour of their own language and that other languages do not belong on the signs there some even experience this as a kind of colonisation of their own language area therefore these activists sometimes vandalise street name signs and road signs by making the undesired language illegible this is especially common in the linguistic conflict in voeren others opine that bilingualism of street names is good for individual understanding and mutual tolerance and that one name is not necessarily better than another they tend to reject resistance to multilingual signs as needlessly hostile and territorial behaviour towards speakers of other languages in the end the meaning of the names is the same and merely spelt differently or a direct translation of the same word world war ii the cyriel verschaeve street in lanaken was named after catholic priest cyriel verschaeve who openly collaborated with the nazis during world war ii and was therefore convicted and sentenced to death in absentia by the belgian authorities in the municipality let its inhabitants choose a new name themselves the majority voted in favour of anne frank street germanyedit cold war in former east germany officially german democratic republic or ddr many street names still refer to the communist era for example streets and squares have been named after ernst thlmann the leader of the communist party of germany who was executed in buchenwald concentration camp by the nazis critics argue that he may deserve some street names here and there but this overload of commemorations has pressed too much of a communist presence in the public sphere the kaiserhof underground railway station in berlin was opened in in renamed thlmannplatz after the nearby square that was called wilhelmplatz until in renamed ottogrotewohlstrae after otto grotewohl east german prime minister and in renamed mohrenstrae the thlmannplatz was abolished in and added to the ottogrotewohlstrae which has been restored as wilhelmstrae in in the city announced that mohrenstrae would be renamed antonwilhelmamostrae for different reasons namely that the term mohren moors was considered racist by many inhabitants instead anton wilhelm amo was honoured for having been the first african person to graduate at a european university braziledit world war ii in because of antiitalian sentiment in brazil during world war ii after a complaint from the national defense league the central square of caxias do sul named after dante alighieri was renamed ruy barbosa square and avenida itlia italy avenue became avenida brasil brazil avenue they were renamed back in military dictatorship in the city council of porto alegre renamed castelo branco avenue named after the first president of the brazilian military dictatorship to avenida legalidade e da democracia legality and democracy avenue referencing the movement dubbed campanha da legalidade legality campaign which sought to keep joo goulart in the presidency in in the avenue was renamed again to castello branco with an additional l after appeals in court claiming that the decision which was taken by simple majority should have had a majority in the council moroccoedit french colonialism versus moroccan nationalism morocco still has many francophone street names from the french colonial era arab nationalists have pressured the government to arabise these and named them after moroccan national heroes but amazigh activists feel they have been ignored and argue for not forgetting to acknowledge their language and culture in the process of decolonisation amazigh versus palestinian names in july the city council of agadir decided to change the amazigh names of several streets into names of palestinian cities to show solidarity with the palestinian question although some amazigh activists agreed that solidarity with palestine was a good cause they regarded the decision as an attempt to erase amazigh culture and history other activists were completely opposed to the move and did not see any advantage to the palestinian cause in it merely an arabising attack on amazigh identity arabic script versus tifinagh in the moroccan city of agadir the tamazightspeaking majority of the population complained that street name signs and road signs were only drawn up in arabic with arabic script and in french with latin script activists from the tamazight language emancipation movement considered this a form of discrimination and en masse pleaded for the addition of tamazight names in tifinagh script which was approved and introduced by the city council in august salafists from gulf states in may controversy arose around the naming of streets after salafist extremists from the arab states of the persian gulf in the suburb tmara of the moroccan capital rabat netherlandsedit municipal authorities can establish rules in order to regulate the naming of streets such rules aim for recognisability utility and personality a wellknown rule which all dutch municipalities maintain is that a street cannot be named after a person until a specific number of years after their death this rule has been introduced in order to prevent a living person still committing a crime or otherwise contemptible act or this being discovered shortly after their death after which the honour of a street name might no longer be reasonable the dutch royal house is exempt from this rule from the moment a new princess is born public streets and roads may be named after them critics argue that this implies the orange family will be living exemplary lives until the day they die while despite the high average popularity of the royals they too are merely fallible human beings who could commit major mistakes and should not be accorded places of honour beforehand language struggle in friesland separation between miedweg and miedwei at the border between stroobos and surhuizum west frisian language advocates including the provincial government and several political parties since the s argue that in the entire province of friesland west frisian and official name frysln or at least the areas where west frisian speakers are in the majority outside of the major cities dominated by the stadsfries dialects that are closely related to the dutch language are provided west frisian street name signs and road signs in order to protect west frisian culture opponents of such frisification claim that these efforts will worsen the segregation between frisophones and neerlandophones lead to needless confusion and costs or that certain historical values will be lost by name changes as of most traffic signs in frieslands municipalities are bilingual with the dutch name on top and the frisian name at the bottom a minority of signs is monolingually frisian and some places have exclusively dutch signs in practice the road signs do not necessarily give an indication of the relative presence of west frisian speakers in a municipality leeuwarden and harlingen for example have bilingual signs but frisian speakers constitute only a small minority of the inhabitants whereas overwhelmingly frisianspeaking achtkarspelen features only dutchlanguage street name signs colonial past overseas an important part of public discourse surrounding street names in the netherlands is concerned with its colonial heritage especially the dutch east india company voc and the dutch east indies the colonial street name controversies usually focus on the personalities of jan pieterszoon coen for his role in the dutch conquest of the banda islands especially the battle of banda besar in and j b van heutsz because of his part in the aceh war and the and bali interventions activists tend to target the coen tunnel and second coen tunnel in amsterdam several dutch cities have a jan pieterszoon coen street including the hague and utrecht and amsterdam has a coenhaven coen port since a coen tunnel since and a second coen tunnel since several interest groups such as de grauwe eeuw the grim age a word play on the golden age have requested that the municipalities involved change these names and the municipalities initially agreed to negotiate however when de grauwe eeuw threatened to perform acts of vandalism to enforce the name changes cooperation was immediately discontinued in july activist group helden van nooit defaced the street name signs of the jan pieterszoon coenstraat and the van heutszstraat in the utrecht residential area of lombokleidseweg with red paint symbolising the blood that has been spilt by these and eight other dutch colonists with street names in this quarter the group demanded all ten streets would be decolonised reactions to the act were mixed the municipality of utrecht reported destruction of property to the police with a spokesperson saying that it is important to have this discussion but the solution is not to amend street names but to raise awareness some neighbourhood residents and city councillors judged the situation differently and argued that the street names had to or were allowed to be changed if people had problems with it some cities in the netherlands have a witte de with street including the hague and eindhoven in the latter locals and de grauwe eeuw asked for a name change in coordination with the municipality as a corsair witte de with had been instrumental in the dutch colonisation of the east indies because many residents of the quarter were dutch turks their request was granted for adjusting the street name to barbarosstraat a reference to the turkish admiral hayreddin barbarossa turkish barbaros hayrettin however because he also was a corsair and slave trader not everyone agreed and a new controversy arose the witte de withstraat in the hague also aroused disputes but that street name has not been changed so far cold war activists replace stalin lane sign with november lane due to hungarian uprising the stalin lane is officially renamedfreedom lane on november in three avenues in amsterdam were given new names in honour of the big three leaders who had defeated nazi germany franklin delano roosevelt rooseveltlaan previously zuider amstellaan winston churchill churchilllaan previously noorder amstellaan and joseph stalin stalinlaan or stalin lane previously amstellaan after stalin died in the period of destalinisation followed a break from stalins personality cult and attempts to formulate a less autocratic policy in the soviet union and its warsaw pact satellite states elsewhere in europe stalin was also viewed more critically when the hungarian uprising another consequence of the destalinisation was bloodily crushed by the red army on november this led to great outrage in the western bloc protesting this turn of events activists removed the street name sign of the stalinlaan and replaced it with novemberlaan on november the street was officially renamed vrijheidslaan freedom lane catholic church sexual abuse cases sometimes street names have been changed after cases of sexual abuse in the catholic church in the netherlands from have been exposed to the public pastor visser worked from until his death in in the catholicmajority village of vasse in the municipality of tubbergen which earned him the pastoor visserstraat in april however several people came forward saying they had been victims of sexual abuse by pastor visser suspicions were raised that altogether there were perhaps as many as dozens of victims according to locals vissers abusive behaviour or at least suspicions thereof had been known for about to years but nobody acted on it and it remained a public secret the investigation of former education minister wim deetman eventually confirmed that visser had abused several boys victims and local residents wanted to change the streets name and the municipality soon converted it into de schoolkolk theo holtslag was appointed pastor in haarle in in this formerly predominantly catholic village in the municipality of hellendoorn almost everyone knew holtslag who had a reputation of being closely involved in the local community after his death in the holtslagweg was named in his honour nevertheless in the early s mayor anneke raven was contacted by someone who claimed to have been sexually abused by pastor holtslag when he was an underage boy the roman catholic archdiocese of utrecht confirmed the allegation in an official letter it is not known whether holtslag has victimised anyone else the pastors former parish was informed about the sexual abuse and on december the municipality informed the inhabitants of the holtslagweg that the streets name would therefore be changed in joint agreement with them residents and old acquaintances of the pastor reacted with shock and dismay and said they had not known about it one resident himself had been one of holtslags altar servers everyone agreed that amending the street name was the proper course of action acting mayor johan coes motivated the decision usually its an honorary recognition naming a street after someone and uh well that is no longer the case here now representativity as of of all dutch streets personal names referred to men the municipality of utrecht therefore decided to name all streets in the new heldinnenwijk heroines quarter after women who were active in the dutch resistance during world war ii with the proviso that they had only committed nonviolent acts of resistance in the municipality of putten a new residential area featured streets named after putten women who were determined to have done something extraordinarily brave such as trientje timmer who had helped people to go in hiding from the nazis during world war ii logistical objections getting ambulances firefighters or police vehicles at the correct place in time can be a matter of life and death making the communication of the street name of vital importance for example if the city of amsterdam had a klaverstraat in addition to its kalverstraat a reading or typing error could be fatal moreover mail carriers other services and citizens can end up confused as well street names should therefore be different enough to avoid probable mistakes the town of maasbracht actually has both a kalverstraat and a klaverstraat but the distance between them is only a minute car drive and is therefore not considered an urgent problem economic objections companies at the noorderkade in alkmaar mounted resistance when the municipality announced on march that their street was going to be renamed koning willemalexanderkade king willemalexander quay on the occasion of the inauguration of willemalexander on april the companies complained that they had invested a lot of money in their reputation with their current address and were not prepared to carry the extra costs of address changes and the risk of losing customers the municipality conceded to the objections and instead renamed the sportlaan to koning willemalexanderlaan spainedit a street named after franco in los cristianos on tenerife march francoist era the francoist period remains controversial in stcentury spain the nationalcatholic regime has left its mark in many street and square namings which some spaniards seek to preserve while others make efforts to erase them on october the socialist zapatero i government introduced the historical memory law which removed all names of general francisco franco himself but left those of his henchmen and his symbols intact arguing that this legislation had not gone far enough madrilene mayor manuela carmena announced in june that names of francos associates and associations would also be removed from the capitals streets and squares ukraineedit russian invasion of
